## Project - Deliverable \# 1 Feedback 
 
I think this is a good project. As you already mentioned in your project proposal be careful with using the Twitter API they have a limit. I never heard of the "Twint" project but I looked it over it seems relatively straightforward to get the data. You should be able to use it in your project. I would recommend that the responsibilities for using this module should be done by a single group member. Otherwise, everything looks good to me.
