## Project - Deliverable \# 1 Feedback 
 
I think this is a good project. As you already mentioned in your project proposal be careful with using the Twitter API they have a limit. I never heard of the "Twint" project but I looked it over it seems relatively straightforward to get the data. You should be able to use it in your project. I would recommend that the responsibilities for using this module should be done by a single group member. Otherwise, everything looks good to me.  

As a followup to your email: 

Idea #1 
--------
How plausible is working with Twitter? Do you think we are going to be able to gather enough data?

I think using the twitter API is fine but you'll need to gather data every day to make it possible to get enough data by the end of the quarter, unless you pay for it. I normally caution students 

Are we going to be able to use packages that does not follow Twitterâ€™s policy on downloading tweets? See, for example, Twint.

Yes, see my comment above but I think it might be more plausible. Unfortunately, I don't have any experience using this framework. I recommend that you experiment over the next few days to make sure it can gather the data you need. 

Do you know good algorithms to produce sentiment analysis on public issues on Twitter? How hard would be the text processing if there is no base algorithm?

There are many python packages that can help with this and articles/tutorials online to help you with implementing the algorithm. For example here,

I recommend that one group member be in charging of purely getting this to work correctly. 


Depending on the complexity of the project from your perspective, should we focus in one area, such as Chicago, or could we incorporate states or other cities?

I think for now you should only focus on Chicago. You don't have enough time to focus in on multiple cities at this point. 

Idea #2 
--------- 
I think this idea is interesting. My major concern is whether you'll have access to the data to perform your analysis. I personally have never interacted with the Spotify API and it might be a bit of challenge to get this idea working within the amount of time that you have left in the quarter. Although an interesting idea,  I would recommend you go with Idea #1 based on time constraints.
