## Project - Deliverable \# 1 Feedback 

This looks good but I don't see much in your repository at the moment so make sure you are making progress. One comment I would recommend is for you to use Dash.

It might be a bit easier to get going then Django but it's not required. If you want to use the Django framework then the best tutorials and documentation is on their actual website. All groups from prior years used the Django website tutorials to help them understand.
